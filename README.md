# Overview

The aim of this project is to buid a Crawler, Search engine and a Text classifiction Model.

In this project, I created an Information retrieval system. This system will begin by crawling data from a specific website. Then I built a search engine that returns the most relevant result retrieved from the crawled data based on user input.

Text classifiction is a machine learning technique that assigns a set of predefined categories to open-ended text. This task is one of the fundamental tasks in natural language processing with broad applications in areas such as topic labelling, sentiment analysis, intent detection and spam detection. 

The dataset used in this section of the project is available publicly on Kaggle. The dataset is a multiclass classification dataset with five (5) responses and 2224 instances.
